- Add signUp and logIn functionality
- Finish route handling for auth check
- Display errors in modal
- Break actions out into 3 different events (NAME__REQUEST, NAME__FAILURE, NAME__SUCCESS)
- SCSS linting
- Tests for endpoints
- Add scopes to models (in particular password vs regular scope for user)
